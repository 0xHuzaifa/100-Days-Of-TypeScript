* Question 22: Intentional Error: Try to produce an array index error in one of your programs. 
* Correct the error before finishing.

* Explain & TIP: Array index errors happen when you try to access a position in the array that doesnâ€™t exist. 
* Experimenting with this helps you understand array boundaries.
