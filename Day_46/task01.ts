* Question 136: Use console.log() to debug and track the value of a variable inside a loop.

* Explain & TIP: console.log() is an invaluable tool for developers to monitor the values of variables, 
* the flow of execution, and to understand the state of their program at various points in time, 
* especially within loops where values change with each iteration.

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(`Variable Value ${i}`); // Logs the current iteration number and the value of i
}
