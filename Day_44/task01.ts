/*
* Question 130: Explain how to export a function from one JavaScript file and import it into another file.

* Explain & TIP: In modern JavaScript development, modules allow you to divide your code into separate files. 
* This makes your code more organized and maintainable. You can export functions, objects, or primitives 
* from one file and import them into another.
