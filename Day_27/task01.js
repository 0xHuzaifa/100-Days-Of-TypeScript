/*
* Question 79: Creating and Accessing Object Properties: Construct an object representing
* a car with properties for make, model, and year. Then, show how you can access the model property of the car.

* Explain & TIP: Objects are collections of properties, kind of like a box for storing related information.
* You can create an object to group related data and access its properties using either dot notation or bracket notation.
